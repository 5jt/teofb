[*Ten Essays on Fizz Buzz*](https://joelgrus.com/2020/06/06/ten-essays-on-fizz-buzz/) is a book by Joel Grus that uses the childrenâ€™s game Fizz Buzz to explore programming concepts. The examples are in Python. 

This repo contains corresponding examples in [Dyalog APL](https://dyalog.com), with commentary.

The repo contains files used by [Link](https://dyalog.github.io/link/) to create a workspace, within which are namespaces corresponding to the book chapters; also a namespace `u` containing general utility functions.

Within each chapter namespace, solutions are named consecutively as upper-case letters. So the first solution is `#.ch1.A`. 

The classic Fizz Buzz problem is to print the numbers from 1 to 100, substituting `fizz` for multiples of 3, `buzz` for multiples of 5, and `fizzbuzz` for multiples of both. To make testing easier, the solutions return a list of strings (text vectors). The function `#.print` will display them in the session as if printed to stdout, e.g.

```apl
      print #.ch1.A
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
fizz
..
```

The classic problem specifies the first hundred natural numbers. The solutions print the first `#.N` numbers. `N` is set to 20 by default; setting it to 100 produces the classic result.
